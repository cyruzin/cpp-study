# CMAKE

CMake is a cross-platform free and open-source software tool for managing the build process of software using a compiler-independent method. 
CMake is not a build system but rather it's a build-system generator. It supports directory hierarchies and applications that depend on multiple libraries. 
It is used in conjunction with native build environments such as Make, Qt Creator, Ninja, Android Studio, Apple's Xcode, and Microsoft Visual Studio. 
It has minimal dependencies, requiring only a C++ compiler on its own build system.

## CPack

CPack is a packaging system for software distributions which is tightly integrated with CMake, but can function without it.

It can be used to generate:

- Linux RPM, deb and gzip distributions of both binaries and source code.
- NSIS files (for Microsoft Windows)
- macOS packages
