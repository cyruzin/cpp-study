## Precompiled Headers

In computer programming, a precompiled header is a (C or C++) header file that is compiled into an intermediate form that is faster to process for the compiler. Usage of precompiled headers may significantly reduce compilation time, especially when applied to large header files, header files that include many other header files, or header files that are included in many translation units.

**.pch** - Visual C++ precompiled header.

**.gch** - GCC precompiled header.

## Compiled Object files

An object file is a computer file containing object code, that is, machine code output of an assembler or compiler. The object code is usually relocatable, and not usually directly executable. There are various formats for object files, and the same machine code can be packaged in different object file formats. An object file may also work like a shared library.

**.obj** - When you build your project for 32-bit Windows.

**.o** - When you build your project for any other supported platform.

**.lo** - Is generally a "library object" that contains PIC code whether manually compiled with gcc -fPIC or using libtool.

## Compiled Static libraries

Static library is a collection of object files.

**.a** - Linux static library.

**.lib** - Windows static library.

## Compiled Dynamic libraries

A shared object is an indivisible unit that is generated from one or more relocatable objects. Shared objects can be bound with dynamic executables to form a runable process. As their name implies, shared objects can be shared by more than one application.

**.dll** - Windows shared object.

**.so** - Linux shared object.

**.dylib** - macOS shared object.

## Executables

In computing, executable code, executable file, or executable program, sometimes simply referred to as an executable or binary, causes a computer "to perform indicated tasks according to encoded instructions", as opposed to a data file that must be parsed by a program to be meaningful.

**.exe** - Windows executable file.

**.out** - Linux executable file

**.app** - macOS executable file.
