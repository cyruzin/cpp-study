# C++ Study

C++ repo for study purposes.

## Install

### Windows

To install GCC on Windows, head to [MinGW website](http://www.mingw.org/) and download the MinGW Installation Manager (mingw-get). Then check the package **mingw32-gcc-g++-bin** on the list and click on "Apply Changes" to install.

Add the binary path to the system variables.

_C:\MinGW\bin_

### Linux

I think most of the distros comes with GCC pre installed.

### macOS

Buy one for me and I'll tell you how to do it.

## Checking installation

```sh
g++ --version
```

### Plugin

Download the C/C++ plugin on VSCode and have fun!
