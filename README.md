# C++ Study

C++ repo for study purposes.

## Install

I'm using GCC/G++ compiler.

### Windows

To install GCC/G++ on Windows, head to [MinGW website](http://www.mingw.org/) and download the MinGW Installation Manager (mingw-get). Then check the package **mingw32-gcc-g++-bin** on the list and click on "Apply Changes" to install.

Optional:

Install GDB for debugging: **mingw32-gdb-bin**.

Then add the binary path to the system variables.

_C:\MinGW\bin_

### Linux

I think most of the distros comes with GCC/G++ pre installed.

### macOS

Just run: brew install gcc

## Checking installation

```sh
g++ --version
```

### Plugin

Download the C/C++ plugin on VSCode and have fun!
